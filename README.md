# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori

This project implements Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transactional data. It's a simple and effective demonstration of how associations between products can be mined using basic machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Implementation of the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining
- Association rule generation with support, confidence, and lift metrics
- Example use case with transactional data
- Clear visualization of the rules generated

## Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python packages
- **`LICENSE`**: MIT License file
- **`README.md`**: Project overview and usage instructions.


## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Mlxtend
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
